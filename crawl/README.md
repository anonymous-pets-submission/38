# Tranco 100k Crawl

Due to GitHub's storage limits, we cannot include the full raw results of our snapshot crawl of the Tranco 100k here.
Instead, we will make the entire dataset available on our website.
As this will deanonymize us, we have included the crawl result for `example.com` here as an example.
